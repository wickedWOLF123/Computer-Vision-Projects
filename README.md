Overview
This project documents my learning progress as I explore various topics in computer vision. Each section contains a brief overview of the concept, the theory behind it, and hands-on code examples implemented in Python using popular libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

Topics Covered
1. Texture Recognition
Texture recognition involves identifying patterns or repeated elements in an image. This can be used to classify surfaces, materials, or even detect irregularities.

Concept: Study of textures and patterns in images using feature extraction methods such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gabor Filters.
Applications: Surface classification, defect detection, texture-based image retrieval.
Goal: Learn to extract texture features and classify images based on texture patterns.
2. Face Recognition
Face recognition is one of the most popular applications of computer vision, widely used for security and identity verification.

Concept: Identification of human faces in images or video streams using feature extraction methods and machine learning models.
Applications: Authentication systems, attendance tracking, surveillance.
Goal: Implement a basic face recognition system using deep learning and OpenCV.
3. Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
SIFT is a robust algorithm for detecting and describing local features in images, particularly useful in image matching and object recognition.

Concept: Detect key points and compute feature descriptors that are invariant to image scaling, rotation, and illumination.
Applications: Object recognition, image stitching, panorama generation.
Goal: Implement SIFT for matching features between two images and explore its applications in various scenarios.
4. Barcode Scanner
Barcode scanning is a classic computer vision task used for recognizing and decoding barcodes in images or real-time video streams.

Concept: Detect and interpret 1D and 2D barcodes (e.g., QR codes) from images using image processing techniques.
Applications: Product scanning, inventory management, payment systems.
Goal: Build a basic barcode scanner using OpenCV to detect and decode barcodes from images.
5. License Plate Scanner
License plate recognition is widely used for traffic monitoring and security. This task involves detecting and recognizing license plate numbers from images or video.

Concept: Use optical character recognition (OCR) to detect and extract license plate numbers from images.
Applications: Automatic toll systems, traffic enforcement, parking management.
Goal: Implement a license plate detection and recognition system using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR.
Tools & Libraries
Python: The main programming language for this project.
OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
Tesseract OCR: For optical character recognition tasks, especially for license plate scanning.
dlib: For face recognition and feature extraction.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: For deep learning applications in face and object recognition.
